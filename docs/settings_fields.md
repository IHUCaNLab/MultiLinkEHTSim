SETTINGS FIELDS
--------------------------------------------------------

- sim_time: maximum simulation time [seconds]
- sta_z_range: range in which the random height of the stations should be picked. Two-elements vector ([min, max]) [metres]
- ch_refresh: time interval between channels realisations. [seconds]
- perfect_rx: enables the perfect reception (all packets are correctly received). Logical.
- pkt_max_retx: maximum number of packet retransmissions.
- ch_bws: channels bandwidths. Vector of size 1x3 ([BW_2.4, BW_5, BW_6]). [MHz]
- traffic_rate: traffic rate for Poisson like traffic. All stations will generate traffic with the same characteristics. [bps]
- show_scenario: display the scenario in a figure. Useful for debug. Logical
- ap_z: access point height   [metres]
- num_agg_pkts: maximum number of MPDUs in an A-MPDU.
- shad_refresh: time interval between shadowing realizations. [seconds]
- mpdu_lifetime: packet lifetime. Expired packets are removed from the buffer. [seconds]
- cca_below_lims: CCA levels for the three links. 1x3 vector. [dBm]
- agg_meth: selects the aggregation method. Three possible choices: 1) TBA; 2) ESA; 3) BPA.
- ap_x: x position for the access point    [metres]
- ap_y: y position for the access point    [metres]
- sta_exes: 1 x Nstas vector containing the x positions of the stations    [metres]
- sta_yis: 1 x Nstas vector containing the y positions of the stations   [metres]
- min_pkt_size: minimum packet size [bits]
- max_pkt_size: maximum packet size [bits]
- model: selects the channel model. Choices: 'Stat_mod' for the statistical models for MMSE receivers, 'Mod_C' for IEEE 802.11 Model C
